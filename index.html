<p>Has been tested on <a href="#">chrome</a> and <a href="#">safari</a>. There is an unresolved issue with <a href="#">Firefox</a>.</p>

<p>The cheetah's <a href="/wiki/Chest" title="Chest">chest</a> is deep and its <a href="/wiki/Waist" title="Waist">waist</a> is narrow. The coarse, short fur of the cheetah is tan with round black spots measuring from 2 to 3 cm (0.79 to 1.2 in) across, affording it some <a href="/wiki/Camouflage" title="Camouflage">camouflage</a> while hunting. There are no spots on its white underside, but the tail has spots, which <a href="#">merge</a> to form four to six dark rings at the end. The tail usually ends in a bushy white <a href="#">tuft</a>. The cheetah has a small <a href="/wiki/Head" title="Head">head</a> with high-set eyes. Black "tear marks" running from the corner of its eyes down the sides of the nose to its mouth keep <a href="#">sunlight</a> out of its eyes and aid in hunting and seeing long distances. Its thin and <a href="#">fragile</a> body make it well-suited to short bursts of high speed, but not to long-distance running.</p>
<p>The <a href="#">adult</a> cheetah weighs from 21 to 72 kg (46 to 160 lb). Its total <a href="#">head-and-body</a> length is from 110 to 150 cm (43 to 59 in), while the <a href="#">tail</a> can measure 60 to 84 cm (24 to 33 in) in length.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Burnie_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Burnie-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Cheetahs are 66 to 94 cm (26 to 37 in) tall at the shoulder. Males tend to be slightly larger than females and have slightly bigger heads, but there is not a great variation in cheetah sizes and it is difficult to tell males and <a href="#">females</a> apart by appearance alone. Compared to a similarly sized <a href="/wiki/Leopard" title="Leopard">leopard</a>, the cheetah is generally shorter-bodied, but is longer tailed and taller (it averages about 90&#160;cm (35&#160;in) tall) and so it appears more streamlined.</p>
<p>Some cheetahs have a rare fur <a href="#">pattern</a> <a href="/wiki/Mutation" title="Mutation">mutation</a> of larger, blotchy, merged spots. Known as "king cheetahs," they were once thought to constitute a separate <a href="#">subspecies</a> but are in fact African cheetahs; their unusual fur pattern is the result of a single recessive gene.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> The "king cheetah" has only been seen in the wild a handful of times, but it has been bred in captivity.</p>
